# macwatch

Track specific MAC addresses in your network.

>arpwatch is a computer software tool for monitoring Address Resolution Protocol traffic on a computer network.[1] It generates a log of observed pairing of IP addresses with MAC addresses along with a timestamp when the pairing appeared on the network. It also has the option of sending an email to an administrator when a pairing changes or is added.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install macwatch`

```javascript
var macwatch = require('macwatch');
macwatch.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
